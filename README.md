```html
<!-- Current image -->
<img id="profile-photo" src="assets/css/images/images/hype-geencoffee.jpg" alt="Green tea" class="sectione-image">
```

Replace with your own image and update the path accordingly.

Update the Google Maps link with your location:

```html
<!-- Current address -->
<a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=Universit√§tstrasse+41,+8006+Zurich,+Switzerland" target="_blank" class="address-link">
```

Replace the coordinates with your actual address.
